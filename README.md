# Brief

In this project, we're going to create tip calculator.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

​

# Users should be able to:

    Input a different bill amount and number of people
    Select a percentage to tip. Only one percentage can be selected at a time.
